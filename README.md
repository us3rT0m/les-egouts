# les-egouts

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Installation

after fork the project and create new branch, you can safely install nodes modules and run it :

via npm

```bash
npm install
```

In the project directory, you can run:

```bash
npm run start
```

# Utilisation

## Dessiner les images

1. In your parent component, create a State
```const [pictures, setPictures] = useState([]);```
2. Create a new component that will display your canvas, assign it a ``useRef`` reference and create a button with a new reference, which will download your compiled image.
   1. Add in 'pictures' props which will receive the parent's pictures.
   2. Add a ``useEffect`` that will update on the pictures props.
   3. Call ``core.draw(canvasRef.current, <pictures>)`` in your effect to display it on your canvas.

## Add an image

1. To add a picture, you need to call ``core.addPicture(file)`` which returns a Promise with a Picture class object.
2. Do your actions in the Promise return, such as forwarding the info to the parent component.

## Edit the image properties

1. You can change the properties of an image with ```core.updatePicture(x,y,width,height)```
2. Feed the info back to the parent to update React with the states.

## Download image

1. Set a download button with a``download="nomfichier.png"``
2. Get the reference of your canvas and convert it to an image then apply the destination to your button.
``const dt = canvaRef.current.toDataURL('image/png');
   downloadRef.current.href = dt;``

## Exemple

You can look at the project above to understand how the package works with React.

# Picture Data


A picture object contains the values :
- id: The id of the picture
- name : The name of the file
- x : X position drawn in the canvas
- y : Y position drawn in the canvas
- width : Width drawn in the canvas (64 by default)
- height: Height drawn in the canvas (64 by default)
- naturalWidth : Width of the image
- naturalHeight : Height of the image
- blob : The file in blob format
- file : The upload file
- render : The image tag with the compiled image as source. (ImageData/HTMLImage)
