# CONTRIBUTORS CODE OF CONDUCT

As contributors and maintainers of this project, and in the interest of fostering an open and welcoming community, we are committed to respecting all contributors by reporting errors, posting new feature requests, updating documentation, submitting pull requests or patches, and any other activities.

We are committed to making participation in this project a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of experience level, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, physical size, race, ethnicity, age, religion or nationality.

**Examples of unacceptable behaviour include**

* the use of sexualised language or imagery 
* personal attacks;
* trolling, or insulting or derogatory comments;
* harassment in public or private;
* publishing private information of others, such as physical or e-mail addresses, without explicit permission;
* unprofessional or unethical conduct.

**The project maintainers have the right and responsibility to delete, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, questions, and other contributions that do not comply with this Code of Conduct, or to temporarily or permanently ban any contributor as a result of other conduct they deem inappropriate, threatening, abusive, or harmful.**

By adopting this Code of Conduct, project maintainers agree to apply these principles fairly and consistently to all aspects of the management of this project. Project maintainers who fail to follow or enforce the Code of Conduct may be permanently removed from the project team.

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces as well as in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or their community.

Instances of abusive, harassing or otherwise unacceptable behaviour can be reported by contacting a project manager at *julien.coudert34@gmail.com*. All complaints will be investigated and considered and will result in a response deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. Maintainers undertake to keep the information of the person reporting an incident confidential.
